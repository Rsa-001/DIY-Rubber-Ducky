# DIY-Rubber-Ducky
A practical, homebuilt “Rubber Ducky”-style USB device that emulates a keyboard (HID) to execute a scripted sequence on a target workstation. The goal is to learn the full end‑to‑end workflow: building the device, writing payloads, safely testing them in a lab, and documenting the results in a clean, repeatable way.
